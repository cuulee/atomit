REST API
========

The Atom-IT server comes bundled with a simple REST API that enables a
programmatic access to the time series from external applications
(scripts, heavyweight clients, Web applications...).  This REST API is
served through an embedded Web server, whose configuration can be
[fine-tuned](Configuration.md#web-server-parameters).

WIP.
